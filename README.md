This application takes in the user input of a city and returns the current weather and a 5 day weather forecast! I used the Open Weather API to get data back in JSON which I then use to populate the page with the information. This was really fun to work on as it was my first time really utilizing a server side API for an application. My main issue with this project was figuring out how to get some of the icons to display on my page. Once I figured out what I was doing wrong with the way I was trying to append them the rest of the project came together smoothly.
